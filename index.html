        <p>My name is Daniela Freire. I'm from Brazil and my first language is Portuguese. I arrived in Canda in August 2023 with my family to study Software Development at Bow Valley College and live in Calgary for 2 years. When I was still in Brazil I decided to make a career transition, since then I feel challenged every day by this new area of ​​work.</p>
        <p> When I'm not working or studying, I like watching movies with my family. I also like to travel when possible, but my favorite place in the world is home with my family. I don't really like playing sports, but I love listening to music.</p>
